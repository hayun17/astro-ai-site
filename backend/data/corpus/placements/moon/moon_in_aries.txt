Moon in Aries — Emotional Needs
You regulate emotions through movement, action, and immediacy. You feel safe when you can be direct and don’t have to hide your reactions. Under stress, anger appears fast—often as a signal that something feels unfair or limiting. You need independence even in closeness; too much control makes you shut down or rebel. You prefer partners and friends who can handle honesty without drama. Shadow pattern: reacting before fully feeling. Growth key: pause 10 seconds—your courage becomes even stronger with emotional timing.
