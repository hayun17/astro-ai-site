Moon in Libra — Emotional Needs
You feel safe when relationships are calm, fair, and mutually respectful. Harmony regulates your nervous system; conflict can feel physically unsettling. Under stress, you may people-please, smooth things over, or avoid direct confrontation. You need kindness, good communication, and emotional reciprocity. You feel loved when choices are shared and you’re treated like a true partner. Shadow pattern: losing your needs in the name of peace. Growth key: speak your preference early—true harmony includes your truth.
