Moon in Scorpio — Emotional Needs
You need depth, loyalty, and emotional truth to feel safe. Surface-level closeness feels empty; you want real bonding and real honesty. Under stress, you may become suspicious, intense, or silently strategic. You feel loved when someone stays present through hard emotions without running away. Trust takes time—and once broken, it’s hard to rebuild. Shadow pattern: testing people or holding power through silence. Growth key: communicate needs before resentment forms; vulnerability is your strongest medicine.
