Moon in Sagittarius — Emotional Needs
You regulate emotions through space, perspective, and hope. You feel safe when life has meaning and you can keep moving forward. Under stress, you may avoid heaviness, joke it off, or escape into new plans. You need honesty and freedom inside relationships; clinginess feels suffocating. You feel loved when someone supports your growth and shares adventures. Shadow pattern: refusing to sit with grief or complexity. Growth key: let feelings be teachers—depth doesn’t cancel freedom.
