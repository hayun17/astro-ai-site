Moon in Gemini — Emotional Needs
Mental stimulation is the foundation of emotional connection for you. You feel safe when conversation is alive and ideas can move freely. Under stress, you may overthink feelings or talk around them instead of sitting inside them. You bond through humor, curiosity, shared interests, and quick emotional responsiveness. You feel loved when someone listens and responds thoughtfully—like your mind matters. Shadow pattern: intellectualizing pain to avoid vulnerability. Growth key: name the feeling plainly—clarity makes closeness easier.
