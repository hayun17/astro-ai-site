Moon in Taurus — Emotional Needs
You feel safe through stability, comfort, and predictable care. Your nervous system calms when routines are steady and the environment feels physically pleasant. Under stress, you may freeze, resist change, or seek comfort through food/sleep/avoidance. You need loyalty and consistency more than grand romance. Touch, warmth, and practical support speak louder than words. Shadow pattern: staying in situations too long because they’re familiar. Growth key: choose security that grows—slow change can still be real change.
