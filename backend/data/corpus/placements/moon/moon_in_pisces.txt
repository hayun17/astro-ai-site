Moon in Pisces — Emotional Needs
You regulate emotions through empathy, imagination, and spiritual softness. You feel safe when the environment is gentle and emotionally kind. Under stress, you may absorb others’ moods, escape, or feel overwhelmed without clear reason. You need compassion, creativity, and quiet time to reset. You feel loved when someone is tender with your sensitivity and doesn’t shame your feelings. Shadow pattern: blurred boundaries and rescuing. Growth key: protect your energy—boundaries help you stay open without drowning.
