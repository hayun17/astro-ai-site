Moon in Leo — Emotional Needs
You feel safe when you’re appreciated and emotionally “seen.” Warmth, loyalty, and playful affection regulate your heart. Under stress, you can feel dramatic—not to manipulate, but because emotions are vivid and immediate. You need a space to express yourself without being judged or minimized. You feel loved when someone celebrates you and stays consistent. Shadow pattern: pride blocking vulnerability—acting “fine” while hurt. Growth key: share the softness under the pride; intimacy deepens when you let people in.
