Moon in Virgo — Emotional Needs
You regulate emotions through order, usefulness, and small improvements. You feel safe when life is organized and problems have solutions. Under stress, you may become anxious, self-critical, or focused on fixing others. You feel loved through practical care—help, reliability, remembering details. You bond by being helpful, but sometimes forget to receive. Shadow pattern: perfectionism as emotional armor. Growth key: allow messy feelings—rest is productive too.
