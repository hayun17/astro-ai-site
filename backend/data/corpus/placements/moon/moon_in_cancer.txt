Moon in Cancer — Emotional Needs
You need emotional safety, warmth, and genuine care to relax. You bond deeply and remember how people made you feel, even years later. Under stress, you may retreat, become protective, or test loyalty indirectly. You feel loved through nurturing—being checked on, comforted, included. Home, family, memories, and familiar places restore you quickly. Shadow pattern: moodiness when needs aren’t voiced. Growth key: ask directly—your sensitivity becomes strength when paired with clear communication.
