Moon in Capricorn — Emotional Needs
You feel safe when life is under control and responsibilities are handled. You regulate emotions by staying functional, productive, and composed. Under stress, you may shut down, isolate, or carry burdens alone. You feel loved through reliability—people doing what they say. You prefer steady support over emotional chaos. Shadow pattern: believing vulnerability equals weakness. Growth key: practice safe softness—letting trusted people support you is not failure, it’s maturity.
