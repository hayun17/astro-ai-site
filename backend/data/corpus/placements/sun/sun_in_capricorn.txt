Sun in Capricorn — Core Identity
Your identity builds through mastery, responsibility, and long-term results. You feel confident when you have a plan and can prove your competence. Under stress, you may overwork, emotionally shut down, or carry everything alone. You value respect, reliability, and earned success. You’re patient with goals and serious about improvement. Shadow pattern: believing you must “deserve” love through achievement. Growth key: allow support—your strength multiplies when you let others in.
