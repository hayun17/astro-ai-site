Sun in Sagittarius — Core Identity
Your identity expands through freedom, truth-seeking, and exploration. You feel alive when you’re learning, traveling, teaching, or chasing a bigger meaning. Under stress, you may escape—physically or mentally—rather than sit with uncomfortable emotions. You prefer honesty, even if it’s blunt; you dislike manipulation. You’re optimistic and future-focused, often inspiring others to take risks. Shadow pattern: overpromising or avoiding commitment when it feels limiting. Growth key: build a “free” life with responsibility—discipline becomes your passport.
