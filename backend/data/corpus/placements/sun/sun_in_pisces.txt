Sun in Pisces — Core Identity
Your identity flows through empathy, imagination, and emotional sensitivity. You feel most alive when you’re inspired—art, spirituality, healing, creativity, compassion. Under stress, you can escape, numb out, or become overwhelmed by other people’s energy. You absorb atmosphere; harsh environments drain you quickly. You’re deeply intuitive and often feel what others can’t name. Shadow pattern: blurry boundaries and rescuing people who won’t change. Growth key: protect your sensitivity with structure—boundaries turn empathy into power.
