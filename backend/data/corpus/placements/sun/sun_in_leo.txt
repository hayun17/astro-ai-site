Sun in Leo — Core Identity
Your identity thrives through expression, pride, and being seen for your genuine heart. You feel alive when you create, lead, perform, or inspire. Under stress, you may swing between overconfidence and feeling painfully unappreciated. You want loyalty, warmth, and clear appreciation—not vague approval. You’re generous when loved properly; you naturally uplift others. Shadow pattern: tying self-worth to attention or validation. Growth key: let the spotlight be a choice, not a need—create for joy first, applause second.
