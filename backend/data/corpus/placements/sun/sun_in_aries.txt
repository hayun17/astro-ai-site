Sun in Aries — Core Identity
Your identity grows through action, not overthinking. You feel most alive when you initiate, compete, and take the first step. Under stress, you can become impatient and treat “waiting” like a personal insult. You prefer directness—if something is wrong, you’d rather name it than dance around it. Confidence rises when you’re trusted with responsibility and freedom to move. Shadow pattern: starting fast, dropping interest when the thrill fades. Growth key: learn endurance—finishing what you start becomes your superpower.
