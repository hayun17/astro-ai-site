Sun in Virgo — Core Identity
Your identity grows through usefulness, craft, and improving systems. You feel confident when you can fix, refine, analyze, and make things work better. Under stress, you may become self-critical and hyper-focused on what’s “wrong.” You value competence and sincerity more than flashy confidence. You often show love through practical help and detail-oriented care. Shadow pattern: perfectionism that delays action or joy. Growth key: allow “good enough” progress—your gift becomes unstoppable when paired with self-compassion.
