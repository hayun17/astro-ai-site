Sun in Scorpio — Core Identity
Your identity deepens through intensity, truth, and transformation. You don’t do shallow—your confidence comes from emotional courage and real loyalty. Under stress, you can become controlling, suspicious, or quietly strategic. You sense motives and undercurrents; your intuition is sharp. You value privacy and trust earned over time, not instant closeness. Shadow pattern: testing people or holding power through silence. Growth key: practice transparent vulnerability—when you share honestly, your intensity becomes healing instead of heavy.
