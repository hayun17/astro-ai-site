Sun in Libra — Core Identity
Your identity forms through harmony, fairness, and meaningful relationships. You feel most like yourself when life is balanced—socially, aesthetically, ethically. Under stress, you may people-please, avoid conflict, or freeze in indecision. You’re naturally skilled at reading perspectives and creating peace. You value respect, mutual effort, and good manners in love and friendship. Shadow pattern: sacrificing your truth to keep the peace. Growth key: choose honesty over perfection—real harmony comes after clear boundaries.
