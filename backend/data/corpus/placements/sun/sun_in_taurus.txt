Sun in Taurus — Core Identity
Your identity stabilizes through consistency, comfort, and real results. You build self-worth by creating something tangible—money, skills, a reliable routine, a safe home. Under stress, you can become stubborn and resist change even when change is necessary. You value loyalty and calm presence more than grand promises. You move slowly, but once you commit, you can outlast almost anyone. Shadow pattern: staying too long in “good enough” because it’s familiar. Growth key: practice flexible security—adaptation without losing your ground.
