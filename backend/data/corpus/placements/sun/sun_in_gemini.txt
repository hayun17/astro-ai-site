Sun in Gemini — Core Identity
Your identity expands through learning, connection, and curiosity. You feel like yourself when you’re exploring ideas, meeting people, and switching perspectives. Under stress, you may scatter—starting many threads and finishing fewer. You process life by talking it out; silence can feel like disconnection. You’re at your best when you have variety, movement, and mental stimulation. Shadow pattern: using humor or logic to avoid feelings. Growth key: choose depth sometimes—one topic, one bond, one craft long enough to master it.
