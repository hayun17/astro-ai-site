Sun in Cancer — Core Identity
Your identity forms around emotional safety, loyalty, and belonging. You feel strongest when you protect, nourish, and create a “home base” for yourself and others. Under stress, you can retreat, become guarded, or test people’s loyalty indirectly. You remember tone and feeling—sometimes more than facts. You’re sensitive to atmosphere, and your confidence rises when your environment is gentle and supportive. Shadow pattern: holding on to the past or taking things personally. Growth key: build boundaries that don’t require shutting down—softness with structure.
