Chiron in Taurus suggests a deep sensitivity around security, self-worth, and the ability to feel safe in the material world.
There may be early experiences that shaped beliefs about scarcity, stability, or whether one’s needs will be met.

This placement often heals through learning to trust slow growth, develop grounded routines, and build inner value independent of external validation.
Healing may include reconnecting with the body, the senses, and the right to receive.

At its best, Chiron in Taurus helps cultivate lasting resilience—turning vulnerability into a steady capacity for self-support and self-respect.
