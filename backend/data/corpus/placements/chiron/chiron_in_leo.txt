[KEY=chiron_in_leo]

Chiron in Leo suggests sensitivity around visibility, creativity, and the right to shine.
There may be an imprint of feeling judged when expressing joy, taking up space, or showing one’s talents.

Healing often involves reconnecting to play, creativity, and self-expression without tying worth to applause.
This placement can develop into a gift for encouraging others—especially those who fear being seen.

At its best, Chiron in Leo supports leadership through heart: showing that confidence can come from self-acceptance rather than performance.
