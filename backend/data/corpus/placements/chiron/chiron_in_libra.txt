[KEY=chiron_in_libra]

Chiron in Libra suggests sensitivity around relationships, fairness, and feeling chosen.
There may be an imprint of imbalance—giving more than receiving, people-pleasing, or feeling responsible for harmony at personal expense.

Healing often involves learning healthy reciprocity, clear boundaries, and the ability to stay connected without losing the self.
This placement can become a gift for mediation and relational wisdom, especially when one’s own needs are honored.

At its best, Chiron in Libra supports healing through equality—teaching that love does not require self-erasure.
