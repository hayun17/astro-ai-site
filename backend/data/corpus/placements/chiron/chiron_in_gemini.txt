Chiron in Gemini points to sensitivity around communication, learning, and feeling understood.
There may be an imprint of being misunderstood, dismissed intellectually, or made to feel “too much” or “not enough” in how one speaks and thinks.

Healing often involves finding one’s voice without over-explaining, and developing confidence in personal perception.
This placement can also bring gifts in teaching, writing, or translating complex feelings into clear language.

At its best, Chiron in Gemini supports healing through words—creating connection by naming what others cannot easily articulate.
