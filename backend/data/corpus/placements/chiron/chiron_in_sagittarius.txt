Chiron in Sagittarius suggests sensitivity around meaning, belief, truth, and direction in life.
There may be an imprint of feeling disillusioned, morally judged, or uncertain about what to trust.

Healing often involves forming a personal philosophy based on lived experience rather than external authority.
This placement can develop gifts in teaching, mentoring, and helping others find perspective—especially after confronting uncertainty.

At its best, Chiron in Sagittarius supports healing through honest exploration: allowing beliefs to evolve without shame.
