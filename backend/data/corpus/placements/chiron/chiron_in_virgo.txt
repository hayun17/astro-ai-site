[KEY=chiron_in_virgo]

Chiron in Virgo points to sensitivity around perfection, competence, and being “good enough.”
There may be early patterns of criticism, pressure, or feeling valued only through usefulness and performance.

Healing often involves replacing self-judgment with self-respect—learning that growth does not require constant self-correction.
This placement can develop strong gifts in practical healing, service, and bringing order to chaos, when rooted in compassion rather than anxiety.

At its best, Chiron in Virgo teaches that wholeness is not perfection, and that care can be both precise and kind.
