[KEY=chiron_in_pisces]

Chiron in Pisces points to sensitivity around boundaries, empathy, and emotional permeability.
There may be early experiences of feeling overwhelmed by others’ emotions, misunderstood sensitivity, or confusion about where the self ends and others begin.

Healing often involves learning emotional boundaries without closing the heart.
This placement can develop deep compassion and spiritual insight, especially when grounded in realistic self-care.

At its best, Chiron in Pisces teaches that sensitivity is not weakness—and that love can be both open and protected.
