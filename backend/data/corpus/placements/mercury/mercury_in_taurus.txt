Mercury in Taurus reflects a steady, practical, and grounded way of thinking.
Ideas develop slowly but with persistence, and once a conclusion is reached, it is rarely abandoned without strong reason.

This placement values clarity, reliability, and tangible results in communication.
Thoughts are often oriented toward real-world applications, comfort, and long-term stability rather than abstract speculation.

Mercury in Taurus supports excellent concentration and memory, especially for information that can be applied concretely.
However, mental flexibility may be limited at times, as change in perspective can feel unsettling.

Communication is calm and measured, favoring consistency over speed.
