[KEY=mercury_in_gemini]

Mercury in Gemini represents a highly curious, adaptable, and mentally agile nature.
Thoughts move quickly between ideas, topics, and perspectives, driven by a strong need for information exchange.

This placement thrives on communication, learning, and social interaction.
There is a natural talent for language, writing, teaching, and making connections between seemingly unrelated concepts.

While mental versatility is a strength, sustained focus on a single subject may sometimes be challenging.
Interest tends to fade once curiosity is satisfied, leading to a preference for variety over depth.

Mercury in Gemini learns best through dialogue, exploration, and constant mental stimulation.
