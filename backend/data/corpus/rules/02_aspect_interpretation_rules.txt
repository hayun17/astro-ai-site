ASPECT INTERPRETATION RULES

Orb priority:
- 0°00–1°30 : very loud / defining
- 1°30–3°30 : strong
- 3°30–6°00 : noticeable
- 6°00+     : background unless it repeats as a life theme

Aspect tone:
- Conjunction: fusion, identity blend, "can't separate"
- Opposition: push–pull, projection, relational mirror, integration task
- Square: friction -> growth engine, trigger pattern, pressure -> skill
- Trine: natural gift, ease, can create complacency
- Sextile: opportunity; becomes real with small effort

Writing rule:
- Always describe how it FEELS + how it shows up in real life.
- Avoid generic lines like "this brings challenges".
- Use mechanisms (avoidance, intellectualization, impulsivity, withdrawal, over-control, people-pleasing).
