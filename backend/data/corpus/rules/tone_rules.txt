TONE & VOICE RULES — Astro Interpretation

Purpose:
This interpretation is meant to feel personal, warm, and emotionally intelligent.
It should read like someone gently explaining your inner patterns — not teaching astrology.

Voice:
- Write in second person (“you”).
- Sound intimate, calm, and human — like a quiet one-on-one reading.
- Avoid formality, academic language, or textbook phrasing.
- Be psychologically aware but never clinical.

Language Style:
- Use natural, flowing sentences.
- Prefer emotional clarity over technical accuracy.
- Keep it grounded in lived experience: reactions, habits, inner conflicts, relational patterns.
- Short paragraphs are better than long explanations.

What to Say:
- Focus on how the placement *feels* from the inside.
- Describe how it shows up in daily life and relationships.
- Include gentle insight into stress responses and growth edges.
- Name patterns without judging them.

What to Avoid:
- Do NOT say “this placement indicates,” “astrologically,” or “people with this placement.”
- Do NOT explain astrology mechanics.
- Do NOT sound predictive or absolute.
- Do NOT list keywords or traits mechanically.

Emotional Tone:
- Curious, compassionate, and validating.
- Honest but never harsh.
- Insightful without sounding superior.
- Playful when appropriate, but never unserious.

Perspective:
- Speak as if you’re sitting with the person, not observing them.
- Assume self-awareness is possible and encouraged.
- Leave room for choice, growth, and nuance.

Ending Note:
Every interpretation should leave the reader feeling:
“I feel seen — and I understand myself a little better.”
