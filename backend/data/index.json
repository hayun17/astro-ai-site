There’s a strong interplay between thought and feeling here — moments where your mind wants clarity, while your emotions ask to be felt without analysis. You tend to oscillate between needing space to stay yourself and wanting closeness that feels safe and real. Your inner world is active, responsive, and sensitive to atmosphere. You pick up on patterns quickly, sense shifts in energy, and often notice things others miss. At times, this makes you deeply insightful; at other times, it can pull you into overthinking or emotional overload. Growth for you comes from learning when to step back — and when to stay present. You don’t need to choose between independence and connection. The real work is letting both exist at the same time.",

It should read like someone gently explaining your inner patterns — not teaching astrology. Voice: - Write in second person (“you”). - Sound intimate, calm, and human — like a quiet one-on-one reading. - Avoid formality, academic language, or textbook phrasing. - Be psychologically aware but never clinical. Language Style: - Use natural, flowing sentences. - Prefer emotional clarity over technical accuracy. - Keep it grounded in lived experience: reactions, habits, inner conflicts, relational patterns. - Short paragraphs are better than long explanations. What to Say: - Focus on how the placement *feels* from the inside. - Describe how it shows up in daily life and relationships. - Include gentle insight into stress responses and growth edges. - Name patterns without judging them. What to Avoid: - Do NOT say “this placement indicates,” “astrologically,” or “people with this placement.” - Do NOT explain astrology mechanics. - Do NOT sound predictive or absolute. - Do NOT list keywords or traits mechanically.
